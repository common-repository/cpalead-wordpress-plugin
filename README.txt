== Description ==

The CPALead WordPress Plugin is the solution to using CPALeads with WordPress. Before, the only option was to include the code after the &#60;head&#62; section of whichever theme you were using, which meant that all of your pages or posts would include the CPALead code.

With this you can pick and chose which pages or posts you want to protect with CPALead and chose whether you want to include a close button or not.
